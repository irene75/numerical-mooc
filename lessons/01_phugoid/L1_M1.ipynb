      "\n",
      "Phugoid is a **long-period reaction to a perturbation** in pitch attitude. A plane, once flying in a stable (trimmed) state, continues on that path indefinitely, until some perturbation (**turbulence, windshear**) affects it away from the stable state. A statically stable plane will always try to return to the stable state. However, it will generally have some momentum by the time it reaches the original attitude, so it will continue a bit further, and then try to return again: an oscillation occurs. A short period oscillation is often the result of a very short and small perturbation, and within a second or two the plane is stable again. A long period oscillation (eg phugoid) is less dampened and continues for quite a while unless the pilot intervenes.\n",
